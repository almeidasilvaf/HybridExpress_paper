summary, this is what we found for each class:\n\n1. **ADD:** redox metabolism (cytochrome P450, heme binding, NAD+ nucleosidase\nactivity, oxidoreductase activity, etc). No difference was observed between\ncontrol and stress conditions.\n\n2. **DOWN:** ATP synthesis, aerobic respiration, electron transfer chain,\nchloroplast thylakoid membrane, organellar ribosome biogenesis, and\nphotosynthesis. Some terms were specific to stress conditions, including\ncell wall organization, galacturonan metabolism, cellulose synthases,\nlipid transfer proteins, and glycoside hydrolases family 9.\n\n3. **UP:** ribonucleases H domain, cytochrome P450, wall-associated\nkinases, serine-threonine kinases, peptidases, redox metabolism.\nSpecifically in stress conditions, genes are associated with abscisic acid\nbinding, lectins, glutathione S-transferases, response to salicylic acid,\nchitinases, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases, pattern recognition\nreceptors, WRKY transcription factors, and systemic acquired resistance.\n\n4. **ELD_P1:** in control conditions, genes in this class were associated\nwith chloroplast organization, circadian rhythm, glycine catabolism,\nphotosynthesis, response to wounding, RNA modifications, phosphoglycolate\nphosphatases, response to water deprivation, ribosome biogenesis, \nand hydrogen peroxide biosynthesis. In stress conditions, no enrichment was \nfound.\n\n5. **ELD_P2:** in control conditions, genes were associated with redox \nmetabolism (heme binding, cytochrome P450, monooxygenase activity, etc).\nSpecifically in stress conditions, genes in this class were associated with\nalcohol dehydrogenases, coumarin biosynthesis, ERF and WRKY transcription \nfactors, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, regulation of defense response, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity.\n\n\n## Saving important objects {.unnumbered}\n\nLastly, we will save important objects to files, so that they can be reused
